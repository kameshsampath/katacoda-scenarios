## Congratulations

You have now learned how to deploy your Spring Boot application on to OpenShift environment.

To Summarize you created a simple Spring Boot project using Spring CLI, added a simple Hello Boot Controller, then deployed it locally to test the API, finally configured the [fabric8 maven plugin](https://maven.fabric8.io) to the project, which allowed you to deploy the project on OpenShift Container Platform.

* [Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes for Developers](https://developers.redhat.com/rhoar) - Here you can get started with a project using different boosters and clone that project to your local computer. This also enables you to deploy your application on your own private OpenShift Container Platform or use OpenShift Online that is provided for free from Red Hat.
* [Project Snowdrop homepage](https://snowdrop.me/) - This site has a lot of details of the work that Red Hat is doing to make Spring work great on Kubernetes and OpenShift.
